## ⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

### 🔧 **Minor Schema Enhancements**

**Missing Constraints**:
```sql
-- Recommendation: Add check constraints for data validation
ALTER TABLE usage_metrics ADD CONSTRAINT chk_quantity_positive 
CHECK (quantity >= 0);

ALTER TABLE billing_records ADD CONSTRAINT chk_total_positive 
CHECK (total_amount >= 0);

ALTER TABLE storage_quotas ADD CONSTRAINT chk_storage_limits 
CHECK (current_storage_bytes <= max_storage_bytes);
```

**Index Optimization**:
```sql
-- Recommendation: Add covering index for user dashboard queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_usage_metrics_user_dashboard_covering
ON usage_metrics(user_id, period_start DESC)
INCLUDE (metric_type, quantity, cost, provider)
WHERE period_start >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days';
```

### 📝 **Documentation Enhancements**

**Missing Elements**:
- ⚠️ Database backup and recovery procedures
- ⚠️ Disaster recovery testing protocols
- ⚠️ Performance monitoring setup guide
- ⚠️ Capacity planning guidelines

### 🔒 **Security Hardening**

**Additional Recommendations**:
```sql
-- Recommendation: Add row-level security policies
CREATE POLICY workspace_isolation ON audio_uploads
FOR ALL TO authenticated_users
USING (workspace_id IN (
  SELECT workspace_id FROM workspace_users 
  WHERE user_id = current_user_id()
));

-- Recommendation: Add audit trigger for sensitive operations
CREATE TRIGGER audit_user_changes
AFTER UPDATE ON users
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_user_modifications();
```
